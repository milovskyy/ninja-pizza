        Ninja Pizza is a premium pizza delivery service to your home and office.
        You will find 17 types of pizzas in our menu: either classic Pepperoni
        and Margarita, or Tom Yam and pizza with tuna made by a chef.

        We have taken the best from every continent: Italian simplicity with its
        amazing cheeses and high-quality ingredients, American filling with an
        insane amount of mouth-watering ingredients, and our special sauce made
        of fish broth and turmeric adds Asian flavor.

        Why is it so delicious?
      </h1>
      <p className="font-semibold max-lg:text-center">
        We do not use cheap cheese and non-dairy creamer, we choose only
        high-quality, natural ingredients. We buy Paleti sausages and tomatoes
        in Italy.
      </p>
      <p className="font-semibold max-lg:text-center">
        We cook pizza crusts made with four types of Italian flour in ovens at
        temperatures above 240 degrees, so our pizza does not fall apart, and
        the sides are always so airy and crispy.
